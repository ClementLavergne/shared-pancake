This is an other paragraph with awesome bullet list:

* Item 1
* Item 2

1. Numbered item 1
2. Numbered item 2

Draw a line:

---

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Left content
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
Right content
:::
::::::::::::::

You can also add images from either document's `images` directory or project's `template` one:

![Normal image](../image/haloinfinite-test.jpg)

But, images can be resized as well!

![Reduced image](../image/haloinfinite-test.jpg){width=50%}

> For PDF: according to the text width only.

Finally, you can use centralized data by just typing the keywords.

For instance: H/W, IPC, SDD and S/W.

It also works with terms and references: your project can own multiple Source Configuration Files.

Please refer to Pandoc User's Guide for more information about filters.
